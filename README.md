# reinfectionsBelinda

Repository for Belinda's MSc work on reinfection. The purpose of this project is to perform simulation-based validation on a model and consists of two parts: \* Run the simulations & analysis with a single dataset \* Perform the simulation-based validation on a Cluster that can run MPI.

# Run a single file on a dataset

# Run the simulation-based validation

## Requirements:

-   CHPC cluster or a cluster that you can run PBS jobs on. The cluster should be able to run R scripts and also have the following packages installed and available:
    -   data.table, iterators, Rmpi, doMPI, foreach, doParallel, coda, parallel, dplyr, ggplot2, jsonlite

## Run a method analysis
